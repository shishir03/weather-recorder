# weather-recorder
Starting in September 2018, I began maintaining a weather station and recording the data I received in a spreadsheet. However, doing this everyday proved to be a tedious task, and eventually I decided to write a google script to automate it (it took a while to make this decision, since in my view writing the script was even more tedious).

Currently, the script updates values every day at about 11:30 PM by pulling data from the Ambient Weather API (as my weather station uploads to ambientweather.net).
